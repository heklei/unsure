## 🧪 Sprint 0: Planning & Setup (Pre-Sprint)

### Objectives:
- Align on scope, tools, and working agreements
- Prepare dev/design environments

### Activities:
- Team kickoff and onboarding
- Set up GitHub, Jira/Notion, Figma
- Define working norms and ceremonies
- Choose tech stack and repo structure
- Draft PDR OKRs

### Deliverables:
- Team charter & roles
- Tooling and environments ready
- Initial roadmap and PDR goals defined

## 🚀 Sprint 1: Discovery & Requirements Finalization

### Sprint Goal:
Understand the users, map the feature space, and validate technical direction

### Backlog:
- ✅ Define core user personas and pain points
- ✅ Competitive research: lore/gamified journaling apps
- ✅ Map features to user goals and behaviors
- ✅ Draft product feature map (Lore creation, Party system, Timeline)
- ✅ Design first-pass user flows
- ✅ Propose initial backend system design (auth, entries, party)
- ✅ Spike: Test Firebase vs Supabase vs custom backend

### Deliverables:
- Persona sheets and research summary
- Product feature map
- Initial system architecture diagram
- Backend tech stack decision log

---

## 🎨 Sprint 2: UX Wireframing & Architecture Validation

### Sprint Goal:
Create visual wireframes, clickable flows, and test data handling

### Backlog:
- ✅ Design wireframes: onboarding, lore editor, profile, timeline
- ✅ Create component library (buttons, cards, avatars)
- ✅ Define DB schema (users, lore, XP, friends)
- ✅ Spike: lore save + fetch via mock backend
- ✅ Write API contracts for core endpoints
- ✅ Create Figma clickable prototype
- ✅ Run internal design review

### Deliverables:
- Low/mid-fi wireframes in Figma
- Initial database schema
- Mock API flows tested
- Validated backend architecture
- Core user interaction prototype

---

## 🔁 Sprint 3: Prototype Testing & PDR Documentation

### Sprint Goal:
Validate the product direction and finalize what will be built in MVP

### Backlog:
- ✅ Conduct moderated usability tests with 5–10 users
- ✅ Analyze test feedback and prioritize improvements
- ✅ Iterate UX flows based on real feedback
- ✅ Implement lightweight working prototype (e.g. lore creation + view)
- ✅ Draft PDR summary deck and documentation
- ✅ Host PDR review meeting with team + stakeholders

### Deliverables:
- Usability test results
- Updated prototype and flows
- Mini prototype (mock backend integration)
- PDR summary doc (PDF, Slides, or Notion)
- Refined MVP backlog and sprint-ready plan

---

## ✅ PDR Exit Criteria

To proceed to MVP build, the team must deliver:

- [x] Validated personas and use cases
- [x] UX flows and tested prototypes
- [x] Technical architecture + DB schema
- [x] Documented API contracts
- [x] Completed usability testing
- [x] Final PDR summary and Go/No-Go plan

## 🔧 Suggested Tools

| Purpose             | Tool                 |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Prototyping         | Figma                |
| Documentation       | Notion, Google Docs  |
| Project Management  | Jira, Linear         |
| Architecture Diagrams| dbdiagram.io, Lucidchart |
| Mock APIs           | Postman, Firebase Emulator |
| Code Repository     | GitHub               |

---

## 🔜 Next Step: MVP Sprint Plan

Once PDR is complete, the team will move into 6–8 weeks of MVP implementation using a refined and prioritized backlog.
