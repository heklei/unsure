🏗️ Agile Sprint Plan – PDR Phase (Preliminary Design Review)
Project: LoreQuest
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
PDR Goal: Validate feasibility, define architecture, and prototype core UX flows
Team Roles:

1 Product Manager

1 UX/UI Designer

2 Frontend Engineers

1 Backend Engineer

1 Tech Lead / Architect

📅 Sprint 0: Planning & Setup (Week 0)
Objective: Kick off the project, define team structure, and align on scope

Key Activities:
Define project charter and success criteria

Align on product vision, goals, and timelines

Choose tech stack (e.g. React Native, Firebase, Node.js, Postgres)

Create working agreement and backlog space (Jira, Notion)

Schedule recurring sprint ceremonies

Deliverables:

Project kickoff deck

Tech stack decision log

Draft roadmap & high-level backlog

🧭 Sprint 1: Requirements Finalization & Technical Discovery (Weeks 1–2)
Objective: Validate key concepts, assess feasibility, define initial data models

User Stories & Tasks:
📝 US-PDR-1.1: Finalize user personas and core use cases

📐 US-PDR-1.2: Create product map (features, flows, dependencies)

🔍 US-PDR-1.3: Conduct competitive/UX analysis (RPG apps, journaling, gamified apps)

🧱 US-PDR-1.4: Draft high-level data model & API diagram

🔌 US-PDR-1.5: Evaluate integration options (OAuth, media storage, push notifications)

Deliverables:

User research brief

Product feature map

Draft ERD & API architecture sketch

Technical feasibility doc

🎨 Sprint 2: UX Wireframes & Architecture Validation (Weeks 3–4)
Objective: Design wireframes for core flows and validate backend architecture

User Stories & Tasks:
🖼️ US-PDR-2.1: Create wireframes for onboarding, lore creation, and timeline view

🧪 US-PDR-2.2: Validate backend architecture (auth, data modeling, draft saving)

🔄 US-PDR-2.3: Design data flow for XP, quests, and friend tagging

📊 US-PDR-2.4: Mock up timeline and co-op questing UX

🔧 US-PDR-2.5: Spike: Try saving/retrieving mock lore data in dev database

Deliverables:

Clickable Figma prototype

Validated backend architecture

Wireframes for 3–4 core user flows

Mock API call test results

🔁 Sprint 3: Prototype Testing & Feedback Loop (Weeks 5–6)
Objective: Validate UX with real users, test API integration, and finalize design direction

User Stories & Tasks:
🎯 US-PDR-3.1: Conduct moderated usability testing (5–10 users) on prototype

🔧 US-PDR-3.2: Build prototype backend endpoints (signup, create_lore, get_timeline)

🎥 US-PDR-3.3: Record and synthesize feedback on lore creation and party system UX

🧩 US-PDR-3.4: Iterate on UX and data flows based on testing

📚 US-PDR-3.5: Prepare PDR Summary Report

Deliverables:

User testing report

Iterated prototype (V2)

Live prototype backend

Final PDR Summary + go/no-go recommendation

✅ Exit Criteria for PDR Phase
To successfully exit the PDR phase and begin full MVP development, you should have:

 Validated UX wireframes and interaction models

 Documented data architecture and key backend flows

 Evidence of user interest and feedback

 Functional prototype (frontend + backend spike)

 Prioritized and refined MVP backlog
